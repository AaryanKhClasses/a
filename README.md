#### How to add More Commands to the bot!
##### In the directory system, you can see a folder named `commands` and another folder named `commands`, add all your commands (NOTE: These **commands** can be inside of other sub-folders too!) in the second `commands` folder!
#
##### After making a command file (for ex., `help.js`), you have to add some pre-written code in every command file you make. The code is as following:
#
```js
module.exports = {
    commands: 'help' // this can also be like `commands: ['help', 'helps'] which can make the command trigger even if you say helps
    cooldown: 10 // number of seconds of cooldown
    callback: (client, message, args) => {
        // your code here
    }
}
```
#
#### - Message Events
##### For setting up message events go to `events/events` folder and add a file (for eg., `guildMemberAdd.js`), you have to add some pre-written code for every event file you add. The code:
#
```js
module.exports = (client) => {
    client.on('the event name here', (event params here) => {
        //event code here
    })
}
```
##### - To see what events are included in `discord.js`, go check [Client.events]
#

#### Heroku (Optional)
##### This isn't a tutorial of how to setup heroku!
##### But if you want to setup heroku, the `Procfile` file in the root directory makes so the bot runs 24/7!
#

#### NOTE: This is NOT a tutorial on how to setup VSC, NodeJS and Discord Bot!
